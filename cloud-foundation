-AWS re/Start â€“ Cloud Foundations Notes

This document summarizes all the key takeaways from the AWS re/Start Cloud Foundations module.

---
 1. Servers, Data Centers, and Virtualization

- A server is a computer that provides data or services to other computers.  
- A data center is a physical location where an organization stores and operates its computer and networking equipment.  
- Hardware virtualization allows you to create virtual machines (VMs) on a physical computer.  
- Virtualization is a fundamental technology that enables cloud computing.

 2. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The phases of the SDLC are:

| Phase | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| Plan | Define goals, requirements, and scope |
| Analyze | Study system needs and constraints |
| Design | Create architecture and detailed system design |
| Develop | Write and build the actual software |
| Test | Verify that the software works as expected |
| Implement | Deploy the software to production |
| Maintain | Monitor, update, and improve over time |

---
 3. Roles in Software Development

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Project Manager | Oversees project planning, progress, and delivery |
| Analyst | Defines and analyzes business or system requirements |
| Quality Assurance | Tests the software to ensure quality |
| Software Developer | Writes, maintains, and improves code |
| Database Administrator | Manages and maintains databases |

### Team Practices
Effective teamwork in software development includes:
- Clearly defining and communicating requirements  
- Documenting the design  
- Using version control systems

 4. Cloud Computing Overview

- Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources through the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.  
- With cloud computing, you can manage your infrastructure as software.  
- The three cloud service models are:
  - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
  - Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  - Software as a Service (SaaS)
- The three deployment models are:
  - Cloud
  - Hybrid
  - Private (on-premises)
- Almost anything you can do in traditional IT can also be done using AWS cloud services.

 5. Advantages of Cloud Computing

| Advantage | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Trade fixed expense for variable expense | Pay only for what you use |
| Benefit from massive economies of scale | AWS lowers costs by operating at scale |
| Reduce guessing about capacity | Scale up or down as needed |
| Increase speed and agility | Launch resources in minutes |
| Stop spending money on data centers | Focus on applications, not infrastructure |
| Go global in minutes | Deploy resources anywhere around the world |

---

## 6. AWS Overview

- AWS is a cloud services provider offering a wide range of global cloud-based products and solutions.  
- AWS services are grouped into categories such as Compute, Storage, Networking, Databases, and more.  
- Choose services based on business and technical requirements.  
- You can interact with AWS in three ways:
  - AWS Management Console
  - AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
  - AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs)  
- AWS documentation is the main resource for detailed help and examples.

---

7. AWS Pricing and Billing

- You are not charged for:
  - Inbound data transfer
  - Data transfer between services within the same AWS Region
- You pay only for what you use and can start or stop at any time.  
- No long-term contracts are required.  
- Some AWS services are free, but related resources may still incur costs.  
- The Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) helps estimate direct and indirect system costs.  
- The AWS Pricing Calculator can be used to estimate service costs.  

 Examples of services with no direct charge:
- Amazon VPC  
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk  
- AWS CloudFormation  
- IAM  
- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling  
- AWS OpsWorks  
- Consolidated Billing  

---
 8. AWS Global Infrastructure

- The AWS Global Infrastructure consists of Regions and Availability Zones.  
- Region selection depends on compliance, latency, and proximity to users.  
- Each Availability Zone is physically separate, with redundant power, networking, and connectivity.  
- Edge locations and regional edge caches improve performance by caching content closer to users.

---
 9. AWS Service Categories

- AWS provides a broad set of cloud-based services across multiple categories, including Compute, Networking, and Storage.  
- The AWS Management Console provides a web interface to access and manage cloud resources.

---
 10. Shared Responsibility Model

| Responsibility | Managed By |
|----------------|-------------|
| Security of the Cloud | AWS (protects infrastructure, hardware, software, networking, and facilities) |
| Security in the Cloud | Customer (configures security, updates OS, sets firewall and security groups) |

For Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings, customers handle tasks like:
- Guest operating system updates and security patches  
- Configuring firewalls and security groups  

---
 11. Amazon S3

- Amazon S3 is a fully managed cloud storage service.  
- Data is stored as objects inside buckets.  
- There is virtually no limit on the number of objects stored.  
- You pay only for the storage you use.  
- Data can be accessed anytime, from anywhere, using a unique URL.

---

## 12. Amazon EC2

- Amazon EC2 allows you to run Microsoft Windows and Linux virtual machines in the cloud.  
- An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information needed to launch an instance.  
- Instance types define CPU, memory, storage, and network performance characteristics.  
- When launching an instance, you must specify:
  - AMI  
  - Instance type  
  - Network, security, storage, and user data configurations  
- EC2 pricing models include:
  - On-Demand Instances  
  - Reserved Instances  
  - Spot Instances  
  - Dedicated Hosts
