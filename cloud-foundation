-AWS re/Start â€“ Cloud Foundations Notes

This document summarizes all the key takeaways from the AWS re/Start Cloud Foundations module.

-Cloud Computing Concepts:
Cloud computing provides on-demand IT resources through the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
The main models are:
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): virtual servers, storage, and networking.
PaaS (Platform as a Service): environments for application deployment.
SaaS (Software as a Service): fully managed applications.
Deployment options: Cloud, Hybrid, and Private environments.
Advantages include scalability, elasticity, global reach, and reduced operational cost.

-AWS Global Infrastructure
AWS operates through Regions, Availability Zones, and Edge Locations to ensure high availability and low latency.
Services can be deployed across multiple AZs for fault tolerance.
Edge locations are used by CloudFront for content delivery and caching.

-AWS Pricing & Cost Management
AWS follows a pay-as-you-go model; you only pay for what you consume.
Tools like the AWS Pricing Calculator and TCO Calculator help estimate and compare costs.
Cost optimization relies on choosing the right instance type, storage class, and region.
Some foundational services (like IAM or VPC) are free of charge.

-Shared Responsibility Model
AWS secures the underlying infrastructure (hardware, networking, physical facilities).
Customers are responsible for configurations, OS patches, access control, and data protection.
Understanding this model is key to designing secure architectures.

-Core AWS Services
Amazon EC2: Elastic compute service for running virtual servers with different instance families and pricing models (On-Demand, Reserved, Spot).
Amazon S3: Object storage service offering durability, versioning, and multiple storage classes (Standard, IA, Glacier).
Amazon VPC: Enables network isolation, subnets, routing, and security controls.
AWS IAM: Manages users, groups, roles, and policies to secure access.

-Summary
The AWS re/Start Cloud Foundations module built a solid understanding of:
Cloud models and deployment strategies
AWS global architecture and cost management
Security through the shared responsibility model
Core compute, storage, and networking services
