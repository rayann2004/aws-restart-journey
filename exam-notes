AWS Exam Quick Reference – Intro
This document contains direct, exam-focused information for AWS services and concepts

-Focused Definitions

1-Lambda – Serverless compute service that runs your code without managing servers, triggered by events (e.g., S3 upload, API call).
2-SNS (Simple Notification Service) – Pub/Sub messaging service that sends notifications to multiple subscribers (email, SMS, Lambda, SQS) simultaneously.
3-CloudTrail – Logs all API calls and actions in your AWS account, providing audit, compliance, and security tracking.
4-MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) – Adds a second authentication factor (e.g., code from app or SMS) to secure AWS accounts, especially the root user.
5-Poll – Mechanism for checking a resource repeatedly to detect changes or receive messages (commonly used with SQS or Lambda triggers).
6-AWS Compute Optimizer
Concept: Rightsizing
Purpose: Recommends optimal EC2 instance types and sizes based on utilization metrics

Exam Trigger: “Analyze utilization to recommend optimal resources” → Rightsizing
| Billing Model                       | Explanation                                                  | Best Use Case / Notes                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **On-Demand Instances**             | Pay only for the compute you use per hour or second          | Ideal for **intermittent or unpredictable workloads**; most cost-effective for weekly/monthly reports          |
| **Standard Reserved Instances**     | Commit 1–3 years for discounted hourly rates                 | Best for **long-term, consistent workloads**; **not suitable** for short-term/intermittent tasks               |
| **Convertible Reserved Instances**  | Offers discounts and allows **changing instance attributes** | Useful for predictable workloads that may need different instance types; **not suitable** for occasional tasks |
| **On-Demand Capacity Reservations** | Guarantees capacity in a specific AZ for a fixed time        | Ensures availability for **critical workloads**; not ideal for infrequent, short-term jobs                     |


AWS Shared Responsibility Model
| Responsibility            | Who      | Examples                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Security of the Cloud** | AWS      | Physical data centers, hardware, network, hypervisors, managed services infrastructure |
| **Security in the Cloud** | Customer | Data, applications, OS (EC2), IAM, network configuration, client-side encryption       |
