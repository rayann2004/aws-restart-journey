This repo is where I’m documenting everything I learn in the AWS re/Start program  from cloud basics to the AWS core services.  
It’s mainly for myself to track progress, practice commands, and have one place for all my notes and labs.

Module 1 – Cloud Foundations
This module covered the fundamentals of cloud computing, AWS global infrastructure, pricing, and the shared responsibility model.

Module 2 – Linux
This module introduced Linux as the foundation for AWS environments and cloud servers.
