# AWS Networking Fundamentals

This document summarizes the key concepts from the AWS Networking module, covering LANs, WANs, VPC architecture, IP addressing, subnetting, wireless technologies, network tools, and important AWS exam topics.

## Network Basics

1. LAN (Local Area Network): Connects devices in a small area such as an office or building.
2. WAN (Wide Area Network): Connects devices over large geographic areas such as cities or countries.

---

## Network Management Models

1. Client–Server: Centralized model where clients request resources from a server.
2. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Each device can act as both client and server for direct sharing.

---

## Network Topology

Defines how nodes are physically or logically connected.
Examples: Star, Hybrid, Mesh, Bus, Ring.

# Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

A VPC functions like a cloud-based, isolated data center where you launch AWS resources. Devices communicate using private IP addresses, and internet access requires a public IP, an Internet Gateway, and proper route tables.

---

## Key VPC Components

1. CIDR Block: Defines the IP address range of the VPC.
2. Subnets:

   * Public Subnet: Has a route to the Internet Gateway (IGW).
   * Private Subnet: No internet route; uses NAT Gateway for outbound traffic.
3. Internet Gateway (IGW): Allows inbound and outbound traffic for public subnets.
4. NAT Gateway: Enables private subnet instances to access the internet outbound only.
5. Route Table: Controls traffic flow within the VPC and to the internet.
6. Security Groups (SGs): Instance-level firewalls.
7. Network ACLs (NACLs): Subnet-level traffic control.
8. VPC Peering: Connects two VPCs privately (no transitive routing).
9. AWS Reserved IPs: Each subnet reserves 5 IP addresses that cannot be used.

## Security Groups vs Network ACLs

| Feature          | Security Group                     | NACL                                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Level            | Instance                           | Subnet                                        |
| Stateful?        | Yes                                | No (stateless)                                |
| Default Behavior | Inbound blocked / outbound allowed | Default NACL: all allowed; Custom: all denied |
| Rules            | Allow only                         | Allow and Deny                                |
| Rule Evaluation  | Evaluates all rules                | Evaluated in order (lowest to highest)        |
| Common Use       | Protect specific EC2 instances     | Control traffic at subnet boundaries          |

# IP Addressing and Subnetting

1. IP Address: Uniquely identifies a device on a network.
2. IPv4 Format: Four numbers (0–255), for example 192.168.1.1.
3. Ports: Identify applications (for example, HTTP uses port 80).
4. Subnet: Divides a network into smaller segments for performance and security.
5. Subnet Mask: Splits network vs host portions (for example, 255.255.255.0).
6. CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing): Uses suffix like /24 to define subnet size.
7. Communication Rule:

   * Same subnet: communicate directly
   * Different subnets: require routing

### Subnet Size Quick Reference

* Total IPs = 2^(32 − subnet mask)
* Usable IPs = Total IPs − 5 (AWS reserved)
* Choose smallest subnet mask where usable IPs ≥ required hosts
* Example: Need ~15,000 IPs → /18 subnet (16,384 total IPs)

### AWS CIDR size limits

* Smallest VPC: /28
* Largest VPC: /16

# Load Balancers 

1. Application Load Balancer (ALB):

   * Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)
   * Path-based and host-based routing

2. Network Load Balancer (NLB):

   * Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)
   * Very high performance and lowest latency

3. Classic Load Balancer (CLB):

   * Legacy option (Layer 4/7)

---

# Hybrid Networking

1. VPN:

   * Encrypted connection over the public internet
   * Easy and fast to set up

2. Direct Connect (DX):

   * Private dedicated connection
   * Lower latency and more stable than VPN

---

# Wireless and IoT Networking

1. WEP: Basic wireless encryption.
2. WPA: Stronger security and key management.
3. BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy): Used in IoT devices.
4. IoT (Internet of Things): Physical devices connected to the internet.
5. IoT Connectivity Options:

   * Wi-Fi
   * Broadband internet
   * Cellular data
   * Narrow-band IoT
   * LoRaWAN
6. AWS IoT Core: Securely connects IoT devices to AWS.
7. Amazon WorkSpaces: Cloud-based Windows/Linux virtual desktops.

# Tools and Utilities to Practice

| Tool        | Purpose                                   |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| ping        | Test connectivity between devices         |
| nslookup    | DNS lookup                                |
| traceroute  | Trace network path and hops               |
| AWS Console | Create and manage VPCs, subnets, gateways |
| AWS CLI     | Manage networking resources via command   |
| Wireshark   | Capture and analyze packet traffic        |
