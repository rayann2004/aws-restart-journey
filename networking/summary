AWS Networking Fundamentals — Summary

This document summarizes the key concepts from the AWS Networking module, covering LANs, WANs, VPC, IP addressing, subnetting, wireless technologies, and key network tools.

## Network Basics

1. **LAN (Local Area Network):** Connects devices in a small geographical area, such as an office or campus.
2. **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Connects devices across large geographical areas, such as between cities or countries.

## Network Management Models

1. Client–Server:Centralized management where clients request resources from a server.
2. Peer-to-Peer (P2P):Each device acts as both client and server, allowing direct sharing.

## Network Topology

Describes how nodes are connected.
Examples:Star and Hybrid topologies.

## Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) functions like a cloud-based data center that is logically separated from other networks. You can launch and manage AWS resources within it quickly.
Devices within a VPC communicate using private IP addresses.To connect to the internet, an instance requires a public IP address, along with network resources like an Internet Gateway and a route table.

Key Components:

1. CIDR Block: Defines the IP address range for the VPC.
2. Internet Gateway (IGW): Enables internet access for public subnets.
3. NAT Gateway: Allows private subnets to access the internet securely.
4. Route Table: Controls traffic flow between subnets and the internet.
5. Subnets: Divide the VPC into public and private zones.
6. Security Groups: Act as virtual firewalls for instances.
7. Network ACLs: Provide subnet-level traffic control.

 | Feature              | Security Group                        | NACL                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Level                | Instance                              | Subnet                                             |
| Stateful / Stateless | Stateful                              | Stateless                                          |
| Default Behavior     | All inbound blocked, outbound allowed | Default NACL: all allowed; Custom NACL: all denied |
| Rules Type           | Allow only                            | Allow and Deny                                     |
| Evaluation           | All rules                             | In order by number                                 |
| Common Use           | Control traffic to specific instances | Control traffic at subnet boundaries               |

## IP Addressing and Subnetting

1. IP Address: Uniquely identifies a device on a network.
2. IPv4 Format: Four octets (0–255) separated by dots (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
3. Port Number: Identifies a specific application or service on a device (e.g., port `80` for HTTP).
4. Subnet: Divides a large network into smaller, manageable networks to improve performance and security.
5. Subnet Mask: Splits an IP address into network and host parts (four 8-bit octets).
6. CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):** Uses suffixes (e.g., `/24`) to define subnet size and enable flexible addressing.
7. Communication Rules: Devices in the same subnet communicate directly; devices in different subnets require routing.
 note:Subnet Size Rule (Quick Reference):
 Use formula: Total IPs = 2^(32 − subnet mask)
 Pick the smallest subnet mask where Total IPs ≥ number of hosts needed
 AWS reserves 5 IPs per subnet → usable IPs = Total IPs − 5
 Shortcut: Find the nearest power of 2 ≥ required hosts
 Example: Need ~15,000 IPs → /18 subnet (2^(32−18)=16,384 total IPs)

## Wireless and IoT Networking

1. WEP: Adds basic encryption for wireless networks.
2. WPA: Improves key handling and user authorization.
3. BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy): Used in mobile and IoT applications.
4. IoT (Internet of Things): Physical devices connected to the internet for data exchange.
5. IoT Connectivity Options:
    Wi-Fi or Broadband Internet
    Broadband Cellular Data
    Narrow-band Cellular Data
    LoRaWAN
6. AWS IoT Core: Allows IoT devices to securely communicate with AWS services.
7. Amazon WorkSpaces: Cloud-based virtual desktops (Windows or Linux).
