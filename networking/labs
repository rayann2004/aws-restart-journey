Documenting lab tasks, observations, and conclusions for the model’s labs.

------------------------------------------------------------------
261-[NF]-Lab - Public and Private IP addresses

Lab Tasks Completed:
Verified EC2 instances’ private and public IPs
Connected to public instance via SSH
Troubleshot Internet connectivity using AWS console and network rules
Explained why public IPs and Internet Gateway are necessary for Internet access

Conclusion:
Public subnet = route to Internet Gateway
Private subnet = no direct Internet access; uses NAT for outbound
Private IPs cannot reach Internet without a public IP or NAT
Use RFC1918 private ranges for all VPCs

262-[NF]-Lab – Static and Dynamic IP Addresses

Lab Tasks Completed:
Investigated the customer’s EC2 instance with a dynamically changing public IP
Launched a test EC2 instance to replicate the issue
Observed that stopping and starting the instance changes its public IP (dynamic), while the private IP remains constant
Allocated and associated an Elastic IP (EIP) to the test instance to create a persistent (static) public IP
Verified that the static IP persists across instance stops and starts
Conclusion:
Dynamic public IPs change every time an instance is stopped and started
Private IPs remain constant within the VPC unless manually changed
Elastic IPs (EIP) provide a static, persistent public IP for instances
Assigning an EIP solves the customer’s issue of IP instability
Use Elastic IPs for instances that require a stable public address
