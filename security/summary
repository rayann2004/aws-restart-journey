AWS Security 

## 1. Introduction to Security

* **Confidentiality** – only authorized people access data
* **Integrity** – data stays accurate and unchanged
* **Availability** – systems available when needed
* Threats: malware, phishing, social engineering
* Security controls: physical, administrative, technical
* Lifecycle: Prevention → Detection → Response → Analysis

---

## 2. Acceptable Use Policies

Define what users *can* and *cannot* do on company systems and websites.

---

## 3. Prevention Phase

Steps: identify assets → assess vulnerabilities → apply countermeasures
Includes: network hardening, system hardening, data security controls, identity management

---

## 4. Network Hardening

Threats: network mapping, port scanning, traffic sniffing
Techniques: disable unused protocols, limit remote admin access, use AAA, firewalls, segmentation

**AWS Firewalls:**

* **Security Groups** (stateful)
* **Network ACLs (NACLs)** (stateless)

---

## 5. System Hardening

* Establish security baselines
* Disable unnecessary services
* Apply patches and updates
* Balance security and usability

---

## 6. Data Protection (Encryption, Hashing, Permissions)

**Encryption**: symmetric, asymmetric, hybrid (TLS)
**Hashing**: verifies data integrity
**Permissions**: ACL-based or Role-based

**AWS S3 Encryption:**

* SSE-S3
* SSE-KMS
* SSE-C

**KMS vs Client-Side:**

* KMS: AWS manages encryption
* Client-side: encryption happens before upload

---

## 7. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

* Digital certificates
* Certificate Authorities (CAs)
* Self-signed vs CA-signed certificates

---

## 8. Identity and Access Management (IAM)

**Credentials:** passwords, access keys, MFA, key pairs
**Components:** Users, Groups, Roles
**Policies:** JSON allow/deny permission documents
**Least Privilege:** give minimum permissions
**Root User Protection:** avoid root, enable MFA, delete root access keys

---

## 9. Malware & Intrusion Detection

* Antivirus protection
* IDS: signature-based, anomaly-based
* **NIDS** (network) and **HIDS** (host)
* **GuardDuty**: AWS threat detection

---

## 10. AWS CloudTrail

* Logs all API calls and actions
* Shows who did what, when, and on which resource
* Used for auditing and investigations

---

## 11. AWS CloudWatch

* Metrics (CPU, RAM, etc.)
* Alarms
* Log management
* Dashboards

---

## 12. AWS Config

* Tracks configuration changes
* Checks compliance
* Sends notifications
* Supports Config Rules

---

## 13. Incident Response, BCP & DRP

**Incident Response:** planning → investigation → remediation
**BCP:** keep business running during disaster
**DRP:** restore systems after disaster

---

## 14. Security Analysis

* Testing
* Monitoring
* Logging
* Defines what is monitored and logged

---

## 15. AWS Trusted Advisor

Checks: cost, performance, security, fault tolerance, service limits

Free security checks:

* Root missing MFA
* Open security groups
* Public S3 buckets
* Public EBS/RDS snapshots

---

## 16. AWS Root User Security

* Never share root password
* Enable MFA
* Remove root access keys
* Use IAM users
* Enable CloudTrail

---

## 17. AWS Compliance

**AWS:** secures the cloud
**Customer:** secures resources *in* the cloud
Supports many global compliance standards

---

## 18. AWS Security Resources

* AWS Support
* AWS Professional Services
* AWS Security Advisories
* AWS Partner Network
* AWS Auditor Learning Path
