 1. What Is Security?

Security means protecting valuable assets such as systems, data, and networks.

 CIA Triad (Core Security Principles)
* Confidentiality – Only authorized users can access data.
* Integrity – Data remains accurate and unaltered.
* Availability – Systems and data remain accessible.

 Common Security Threats
* Malware
* Phishing
* Social Engineering

 Security Controls
* Physical – locks, cameras, datacenter guards
* Administrative – policies, training
* Technical – firewalls, encryption, IAM

 Security Lifecycle
1. Prevention
2. Detection
3. Response
4. Analysis


 2. Prevention Phase 

Prevention aims to stop threats before they occur.

Three Main Tasks
1. Identify assets that must be protected.
2. Assess vulnerabilities in those assets.
3. Implement countermeasures to reduce risk.

 Layers of a Strong Prevention Strategy
* Network hardening
* System hardening
* Data security controls
* Identity management


3. Network Hardening

Network hardening protects the network infrastructure through configuration and design.

 Common Network Threats
* Network mapping
* Port scanning
* Traffic sniffing

 Network Hardening Techniques
* Disable unused protocols and secure weak ones (especially discovery protocols).
* Limit remote administrative access.
* Use AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting).
* Use firewalls close to the traffic source.
* Segment the network into subnets.

 AWS Network Hardening Tools
* Security Groups – instance-level firewalls
* Network ACLs – subnet-level firewalls

Amazon Inspector 
Amazon Inspector automatically scans AWS resources (Lambda, EC2, ECR) for vulnerabilities and outdated packages.
It reports security issues with severity levels and gives clear remediation steps. After you fix the issue, it rescans and marks the finding as resolved.
