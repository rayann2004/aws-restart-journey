# AWS Security –

## 1. Introduction to Security

Security is the practice of **protecting valuable assets**.
Effective information security is built on three core principles:

* **Confidentiality** – keeping information private and accessible only to authorized users
* **Integrity** – ensuring information is accurate and unaltered
* **Availability** – ensuring information and systems are accessible when needed

Common security issues include **malware, phishing, and social engineering**.
Strong security relies on implementing **security controls across the entire security lifecycle**, and in cloud environments, defining shared **security responsibilities**.
Security controls can be **physical**, **administrative**, or **technical**.

The **security lifecycle** includes:

1. Prevention
2. Detection
3. Response
4. Analysis

---

## 2. Acceptable Use Policies

Acceptable Use Policies define how users can and cannot use a company’s services and websites.
They prohibit activities such as:

* Illegal or fraudulent behavior
* Actions that harm the security or availability of systems
* Sending unsolicited bulk messages (“spam”)

Organizations may investigate policy violations, disable access to harmful content, and expect users to cooperate. Reports of violations follow a defined abuse-reporting process.

---

## 3. Prevention Phase

Preventive measures aim to **stop threats before they occur**.
This phase includes three major tasks:

1. **Identify assets** that need protection
2. **Assess vulnerabilities** affecting those assets
3. **Implement countermeasures**

A strong prevention strategy uses **multiple layers of defense**, including:

* Network hardening
* System hardening
* Data security controls
* Identity management

---

## 4. Network Hardening

Network hardening uses configuration and architectural best practices to protect infrastructure.
Common network threats include:

* Network mapping(the process of discovering and visualizing the devices, hosts, and connections that exist within a network.)
* Port scanning
* Traffic sniffing

Key hardening techniques:

* Disable unused or vulnerable protocols, especially discovery protocols
* Limit remote administrative access
* Implement AAA (authentication, authorization, accounting)
* Use firewalls to filter traffic at the source
* Segment networks into subnets

In AWS, firewalls are implemented using **security groups** and **network ACLs**.

---

## 5. System Hardening

System hardening reduces the number of vulnerabilities a system exposes.
Effective techniques include:

* Establishing a **security baseline** (A defined standard configuration that ensures consistent and secure system settings.)
* Disabling unnecessary services
* Applying patches regularly (Keeping the system updated to fix known vulnerabilities.)

Hardening must strike a balance between **security** and **system usability**.

## 6. Data Protection: Encryption, Hashing & Permissions

* **Encryption** protects **confidentiality**

  * Types: symmetric, asymmetric, and hybrid
  * Hybrid encryption is widely used in TLS/SSL

* **Hashing** protects **data integrity**
   Verify that data has not been altered
   Compare the original hash with a newly generated hash.
   If they match → the data is intact.
   If they don’t → the data has been modified or corrupted.

* **Permissions** define *who* can access a resource and *how* it can be accessed

  * Implemented using **ACLs** or **role-based access models**

---

## 7. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

PKI provides the principles and components needed to secure resources using **keys and digital certificates**.

Key parts:

* A **digital certificate** represents the online identity of a user, system, or entity
* A **Certificate Authority (CA)** issues and signs certificates and manages trust
* Certificates can be **self-signed** or **CA-signed**

---

## 8. Identity and Access Management (IAM)

IAM helps securely control access to AWS resources.

IAM credentials include:

* Email and password
* IAM username and password
* Access key + secret key
* MFA
* Key pairs

IAM allows you to:

* Create **users**, **groups**, and **roles**
* Use roles to define **permissions** for AWS resources

---

## 9. Malware & Intrusion Detection

* **Antivirus software** detects, prevents, and removes malware using signature databases
* **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** generate alerts for security threats

  * Signature-based or anomaly-based detection
   Signature-based detection — matches activity to known attack patterns
   Anomaly-based detection — identifies behavior that deviates from normal activity

  *IDS types:
    Network-based IDS (NIDS) — monitors network traffic
    Host-based IDS (HIDS) — monitors activity on individual devices or servers

In AWS, Amazon GuardDuty continuously monitors your AWS account, workloads, and data, and provides ongoing threat detection.

---

## 10. AWS CloudTrail

CloudTrail records all activity across Regions in an AWS account.
It provides visibility into:

* Who did what
* When actions occurred
* Which resources were affected

Because everything in AWS is recorded as an event, CloudTrail helps with **governance, compliance, and auditing**.

CloudTrail = Logs all activity. GuardDuty = Analyzes those logs to detect attacks.

---

## 11. AWS Config

AWS Config tracks configuration changes across AWS resources.
It helps you:

* Answer configuration-related questions
* Demonstrate compliance
* Detect and troubleshoot vulnerabilities

You can also:

* Define **Config rules** to enforce best practices
* Receive notifications when resources are created, modified, or deleted
* View relationships between resources

---

## 12. Incident Response, BCP & DRP

Effective security incidents follow three steps:

1. Planning
2. Investigating
3. Remediating

A **Business Continuity Plan (BCP)** and **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)** define how to **prevent outages** and **recover quickly**.
AWS provides services and guidance to support disaster recovery in cloud environments.

| Concept | What it means                                 | Focus      |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **BCP** | Keep the business running **during** disaster | Continuity |
| **DRP** | Recover systems **after** disaster            | Recovery   |


---

## 13. Security Analysis

Security analysis strengthens security controls.
Core activities include:

* **Testing**
* **Monitoring**
* **Logging**

Policies define:

* What is monitored
* Who performs it
* When and how monitoring occurs
* What is logged and how logs are managed

---

## 14. AWS Trusted Advisor

Trusted Advisor provides real-time recommendations for security, cost, performance, and reliability.

Security checks include:

* Detecting security groups with overly open ports
* Reviewing IAM permissions usage
* Warning if MFA is missing on the root account
* Ensuring S3 buckets are not publicly accessible

---

## 15. AWS Root User Security

The AWS root user has full administrator access.

Best practices:

* Never share root credentials
* Delete root user access keys
* Create an IAM user for every individual
* Always enable MFA
* Enable CloudTrail and billing logs for visibility and cost tracking

---

## 16. AWS Compliance

AWS helps customers understand the security controls in place inside the cloud.
Compliance is shared:

* AWS secures the cloud infrastructure
* Customers secure what they build on top of it

AWS supports many global security standards and certifications to help organizations meet regulatory requirements.

---

## 17. AWS Security Resources

Security resources include:

* AWS account teams
* AWS Support plans
* AWS Professional Services & AWS Partner Network
* AWS security advisories and bulletins
* AWS Auditor Learning Path
