# AWS re/Start – Linux Fundamentals Notes

In this document, I’m listing key concepts and commands I learned about **Linux** as part of the **AWS re/Start program**.  

# Overview
# Linux is an open-source OS similar to Unix.
# A distribution combines the Linux kernel with other software.
# Most distros use Bash as the default shell.
# Use 'man' to read command manuals.
# User data: /etc/passwd (user info) and /etc/shadow (passwords)
# Daemons are background services that start at boot.
# Login scripts: ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_history
# Root user (UID 0) has full control. Linux is case-sensitive.
# Use TAB for auto-completion.

# Common Commands
pwd                 # Print working directory
ls                  # List files and directories
cd                  # Change directory
touch file          # Create or update a file
cat file            # Show file contents
whoami              # Show current user
hostname            # Show system name
history             # Show previously used commands
sudo apt update     # Update package lists
sudo apt install pkg# Install new software
clear               # Clear terminal screen
exit                # Close session or logout

# Users & Permissions
# Users and groups control access to system files.
# Root user has all permissions.
su user             # Switch user
su -                # Switch to root
sudo command        # Run one command as root
AM is an AWS service that is used to manage users and access to resources.


# Editing Files
vim file            # Open file with Vim
# i = insert mode | Esc + :wq = save & quit | :q! = quit w/o saving

nano file           # Open file with Nano
# Ctrl+O = Save | Ctrl+X = Exit

# gedit:A GUI application for editing files

# I/O Streams
# stdin (0): Input | stdout (1): Output | stderr (2): Errors
cat 0<file.txt
ls 1>out.txt
find / -name "*" 2>errors.txt
