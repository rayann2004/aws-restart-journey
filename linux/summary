In this document, Iâ€™m listing key concepts and commands I learned about Linux as part of the AWS re/Start program

Overview
-Linux is an open-source OS similar to Unix.
-A distribution combines the Linux kernel with other software.
-Most distros use Bash as the default shell.
-Use man to read Linux manual pages.
-User data is stored in /etc/passwd (user info) and /etc/shadow (passwords)
-Daemons: Background processes that start at boot and provide services
